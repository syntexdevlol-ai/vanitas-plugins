# Bulk Guild Leaver

Leave multiple servers (guilds) in one action with a confirmation prompt and an optional delay between leaves.

## Install (Bunny / Revenge / Vendetta / Keetu)

Paste this folder URL into your client plugin installer:

```txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntexdevlol-ai/vanitas-plugins/main/plugins/bulk-guild-leaver/
```

## How To Use

1. Open the plugin settings (Plugins list -> tap the plugin's wrench/settings button; or `Discord Settings -> Keetu/Kettu -> Vanitas Plugins` if the settings row shows up).
2. Search and select the guilds you want to leave.
3. (Optional) Set a delay in milliseconds (recommended to reduce rate-limit risk).
4. Tap **Leave Selected** and confirm.
5. Watch progress. Tap **Stop** to cancel after the current guild.

## Notes

- This plugin only leaves guilds you select; nothing runs automatically.
- If you own a server, Discord usually won’t let you leave until you transfer ownership or delete it (it will count as a failure).
- You may need an invite to re-join a server after leaving.
